# whatsapp_msg_bomb

It is basically a whatsapp message bombing tool which was developed by me during Covid Lockdown.

The idea of developing this was basicaaly to reply to a friend who used to spam messages to me using some apps. So I developed my own such tool to overcome the situation.

It uses selenium web testing library to use whatsapp web as a source to send messages. Also it uses some basic python packages and functions to send a user provided number of messages to a particular person in the contacts of the user.

The GUI for this tool is also developed and is user friendly so that anyone can have fun with there friends.
